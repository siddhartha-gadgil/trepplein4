/**

 * Lean is an interactive theorem prover based on dependent type theory.  For
 * additional trust, Lean can export the generated proofs so that they can be
 * independently verified. The lean 3 export format
 * is at [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/export_format.md]]),
 * The changes for Lean 4 are documented at [[https://github.com/leanprover/lean4export]],
 * which is the program that generates the exported proofs.
 * 
 * Trepplein is a tool that can check these exported proofs. This was developed by Gabriel Ebner.
